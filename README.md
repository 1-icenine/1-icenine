> Hey, I'm **Nick**!

> I work on small hobby projects in topics I like: data visualizations, IoT, automation, and process simulations. My goal has always been to create accessible and efficient code without compromising on quality. When I'm not programming, you can expect me to be playing blues music with my guitar or studying some Cantonese.
